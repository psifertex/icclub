### Recommended Cubes

Note that many cubes come in both stickered and stickerless, don't accidentally order the wrong one if you have a preference. Most of these are probably overkill for beginning cuberse but they do feel nice! Cubes are very much a matter of personal preference though, so ask around at the club if you want to try different cubes first to get a sense for how they feeel. Also realize that you can tune the cubese with lubricant, different settings, different springs, and even sometimes customize the magnet strength depending on the cube. 

- $9-$11: GuHong V3 M: If you want to buy thee recommended $11 cube, you can either get it yourself [cubedepot](https://cubedepotusa.com/products/dayan-guhong-v3-m), [scs](https://speedcubeshop.com/products/dayan-guhong-v3-magnetic-3x3), or [cubicle](https://www.thecubicle.com/products/dayan-guhong-v3-m) or bring cash to a future meeting. At 54mm, slightly smaller than other cubes, this is not only a great cube for kids but a great calue. Comes great out kf the box. Magnets, but no customization othee than tension. 
- $23-$26 TengYun M: [cubedepot](https://cubedepotusa.com/collections/new-products/products/dayan-tengyun-m-3x3), [scs](https://speedcubeshop.com/products/dayan-tengyun-m-3x3), [cubicle](https://www.thecubicle.com/products/dayan-tengyun-m-3x3). The TengYun is known as a very good mid-tier cube and is best known as one of the quietest cubes. 
- $23-$26 WeiLong GTS 2 M: [cubedepot](https://cubedepotusa.com/products/moyu-weilong-gts2-m), [scs](https://speedcubeshop.com/products/moyu-weilong-gts2-m-3x3), [3cubicle](https://www.thecubicle.com/products/moyu-weilong-gts2-m). One of my favorite cubes with fantastic performance, it lacks the customization of more expensive cubes but has amazing performance. I prefer its performande over the TengYun at the same price but it is much noiser. It is possible to quiet most cubes though with the right lube and settings. 
- $34.95-$35.99: GAN 354 M V2: [scs](https://speedcubeshop.com/products/gan-354-magnetic-3x3-v2), [cubicle](https://www.thecubicle.com/products/gan354-m-v2) (V2 has some minor improvements over v1, but v1 is fine too)
- $49.99-$59.95: GAN 356 XS: [cubedepot](https://cubedepotusa.com/products/gan356-xs), [scs](https://speedcubeshop.com/products/gan-356-xs-magnetic-3x3), [cubicle](https://www.thecubicle.com/products/gan356-xs)

For most students, any of the three cheapest cubes should be fine. Almost all modern cubes perform so well that the only major difference the highest end ones offer is the anount of customization and it takes a while to even be able to tell what customization will work for you. 

Finally, if you're looking for the best budget cube to share with friends, the <$5 [YuXin Little Magic](https://cubedepotusa.com/products/yuxin-little-magic-3x3) is generally considered a great cube for the price (though it has no magnets).
