# Indialantic Cubing Club

Welcome to the Indialantic Cubing Club.

## Signups

_Update 2020-04-23_: Given the COVID-19 situation, cubing club meetings has been postponed until further notice. We're going to continue to practice however and we'll be putting out lessons online on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8sr_DiBEPqcjXpj23mtgRA/videos). Also, I have spare cubes, so if your student doesn't have one to practice at home with, please [let us know](#contact). Anyone that already paid for snacks, we're happy to convert your snack money into a cube instead to practice while we're all practicing our social distancing. For anyone who hasn't paid yet, the cubes are only $10.

### Recommended Cubes

Note that many cubes come in both stickered and stickerless, don't accidentally order the wrong one if you have a preference. Most of these are probably overkill for beginning cubers but they do feel nicer! Cubes are very much a matter of personal preference though, so ask around at the club if you want to try different cubes first to get a sense for how they feel. Also realize that you can tune the cubes with lubricant, different settings, different springs, and even sometimes customize the magnet strength depending on the cube. 

- $9-$11: GuHong V3 M: If you want to buy the recommended $11 cube, you can either get it yourself [cubedepot](https://cubedepotusa.com/products/dayan-guhong-v3-m), [scs](https://speedcubeshop.com/products/dayan-guhong-v3-magnetic-3x3), or [cubicle](https://www.thecubicle.com/products/dayan-guhong-v3-m) or bring cash to a future meeting. At 54mm, slightly smaller than other cubes, this is not only a great cube for kids but a great value. Comes great out of the box. Magnets, but no customization other than tension. 
- $23-$26 TengYun M: [cubedepot](https://cubedepotusa.com/collections/new-products/products/dayan-tengyun-m-3x3), [scs](https://speedcubeshop.com/products/dayan-tengyun-m-3x3), [cubicle](https://www.thecubicle.com/products/dayan-tengyun-m-3x3). The TengYun is known as a very good mid-tier cube and is best known as one of the quietest cubes. 
- $23-$26 WeiLong GTS 2 M: [cubedepot](https://cubedepotusa.com/products/moyu-weilong-gts2-m), [scs](https://speedcubeshop.com/products/moyu-weilong-gts2-m-3x3), [3cubicle](https://www.thecubicle.com/products/moyu-weilong-gts2-m). One of my favorite cubes with fantastic performance, it lacks the customization of more expensive cubes but has amazing performance. I prefer its performance over the TengYun at the same price but it is noiser. It is possible to quiet most cubes though with the right lube and settings. 
- $34.95-$35.99: GAN 354 M V2: [scs](https://speedcubeshop.com/products/gan-354-magnetic-3x3-v2), [cubicle](https://www.thecubicle.com/products/gan354-m-v2) (V2 has some minor improvements over v1, but v1 is fine too). Very nice high-end cube and also 54mm which makes it great for smaller hands, and recent models use a nice textured finish which "breaks in" well over time. 
- $49.99-$59.95: GAN 356 XS: [cubedepot](https://cubedepotusa.com/products/gan356-xs), [scs](https://speedcubeshop.com/products/gan-356-xs-magnetic-3x3), [cubicle](https://www.thecubicle.com/products/gan356-xs) One of the most expensive flagship cubes, it's best features are the amount of customization it can do out of the box. 

For most students, any of the three cheapest cubes should be fine. Almost all modern cubes perform so well that the only major difference the highest end ones offer is the amount of customization and it takes a while to even be able to tell what customization will work best for you. 

Finally, if you're looking for the best budget cube to share with friends, the <$5 [YuXin Little Magic](https://cubedepotusa.com/products/yuxin-little-magic-3x3) is generally considered a great cube for the price (though it has no magnets).
