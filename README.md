### Recommended Cubes

Note that many cubes come in both stickered and stickerless, don't accidentally order the wrong one if you have a preference. Most of these are probably overkill for beginning cuberse but they do feel nice! Cubes are very much a matter of personal preference though, so ask around at the club if you want to try different cubes first to get a sense for how they feeel. Also realize that you can tune the cubese with lubricant, different settings, different springs, and even sometimes customize the magnet strength depending on the cube. 

$9-$11: GuHong V3 M: If you want to buy thee recommended $11 cube, you can either get it yourself [1](https://cubedepotusa.com/products/dayan-guhong-v3-m), [2](https://speedcubeshop.com/products/dayan-guhong-v3-magnetic-3x3), or [3](https://www.thecubicle.com/products/dayan-guhong-v3-m) or bring cash to a future meeting.
